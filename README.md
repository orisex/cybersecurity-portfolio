## 🛡️ Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome! This is my growing collection of cybersecurity projects completed during my training and hands-on labs. Each project demonstrates skills in Linux, incident response, internal audits, and more.

## ✅ Featured Projects

- 🔐 [Linux File Permissions Portfolio](https://github.com/orisex/linux-file-permissions-portfolio)  
  A practical demonstration of Linux permissions using `chmod` and user/group ownership to enforce the principle of least privilege.

- 🏢 [Internal Security Audit – Botium Toys](https://github.com/orisex/internal-security-audit-botium-toys)  
  An internal audit report for a fictional toy company, identifying vulnerabilities and offering actionable security improvements.

- 🌐 [DDoS Incident Report + NIST Framework](https://github.com/orisex/Incident-Report-DDoS-Attack-on-Internal-Network-NIST-Framework-Analysis-)  
  A detailed simulation and analysis of a DDoS attack. Includes incident response using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

- 📊 [SQL Investigations – Login & Employee Data](https://github.com/orisex/Cybersecurity-SQL-Investigations-Portfolio)  
  SQL queries used to investigate failed logins, after-hours activity, and employee access, using `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, and `LIKE` for targeted data analysis.

- 📝 [Vulnerability Assessment Report](https://github.com/orisex/vulnerability-assessment-report)  
  A vulnerability assessment of a remote database server using NIST SP 800-30 guidelines. Includes risk analysis, threat identification, and remediation recommendations.

- 📓 [Incident Handler’s Journal](https://github.com/orisex/Incident-Handlers-Journal)  
  A complete journal of incident handling exercises, including phishing investigations, custom IDS rule creation, log analysis, and SIEM search practice. Demonstrates practical incident response workflows and documentation.

- 🐍 [Algorithm for File Updates in Python](https://github.com/orisex/Algorithm-for-File-Updates-in-Python)  
  A Python script that automates access control by updating an IP allow list. Reads IPs from a file, removes unauthorized addresses using a second list, and rewrites the cleaned list back to the file. Demonstrates file handling, conditionals, loops, and string/list methods in a security context.
